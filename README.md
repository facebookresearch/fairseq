**Additionally:**
- multi-GPU (distributed) training on one machine or across multiple machines
- fast generation on both CPU and GPU with multiple search algorithms implemented:
  - beam search
  - Diverse Beam Search ([Vijayakumar et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424))
  - sampling (unconstrained, top-k and top-p/nucleus)
- large mini-batch training even on a single GPU via delayed updates
- mixed precision training (trains faster with less GPU memory on [NVIDIA tensor cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores))
- extensible: easily register new models, criterions, tasks, optimizers and learning rate schedulers

We also provide [pre-trained models for translation and language modeling](#pre-trained-models-and-examples)
with a convenient `torch.hub` interface:
```python
en2de = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'transformer.wmt19.en-de.single_model')
en2de.translate('Hello world', beam=5)
# 'Hallo Welt'
```
See the PyTorch Hub tutorials for [translation](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_fairseq_translation/)
and [RoBERTa](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_fairseq_roberta/) for more examples.

# Requirements and Installation

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.4.0
* Python version >= 3.6
* For training new models, you'll also need an NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)
* **For faster training** install NVIDIA's [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library with the `--cuda_ext` and `--deprecated_fused_adam` options

To install fairseq:
```bash
pip install fairseq
```

On MacOS:
```bash
CFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" pip install fairseq
```

If you use Docker make sure to increase the shared memory size either with
`--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` as command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.

**Installing from source**

To install fairseq from source and develop locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable .
```
