What is Abilify?
Abilify is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole.
It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as an oral solution (1 mg/ ml) and as a solution for injection (7.5 mg/ ml).
What is Abilify used for?
Abilify is used to treat adults with the following mental illnesses: • schizophrenia, a mental illness with a number of symptoms, including disorganised thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), suspiciousness and delusions (mistaken beliefs); • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormally high mood), alternating with periods of normal mood.
They may also have episodes of depression.
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.
The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abilify used?
For schizophrenia, the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day.
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day, but higher doses may benefit some patients.
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
For both illnesses, the oral solution or orodispersible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.
The orodispersible tablets are taken by being placed on the tongue, where they disintegrate quickly in the saliva, or by mixing them in water before swallowing.
The solution for injection is only for short-term use and should be replaced by tablets, orodispersible tablets or oral solution as soon as possible: the usual dose is 9.75 mg as a single injection into the upper arm or buttock muscle, but effective doses range between 5.25 and 15 mg.

Abilify can be taken with or without food.
The daily dose of Abilify should not exceed 30 mg, but this dose should be used with caution in patients who have severe problems with their liver.
The dose of Abilify should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as Abilify.
Abilify has not been studied in children aged below 18 years or adults aged over 65 years.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Abilify work?
The active substance in Abilify, aripiprazole, is an antipsychotic medicine.
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it attaches to several different receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain.
This disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by ‘ neurotransmitters’, chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other.
Aripiprazole is thought to act mainly by being a ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).
This means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters.
Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, aripiprazole helps to normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from returning.
How has Abilify been studied?
For the treatment of schizophrenia, there were three main short-term studies of Abilify tablets lasting four to six weeks, which involved 1,203 patients and compared Abilify with placebo (a dummy treatment).
The effectiveness of Abilify in preventing symptoms from returning was assessed in three studies lasting up to a year, two of which used haloperidol (another antipsychotic medicine) as a comparator.
The effectiveness of the solution for injection was compared with placebo over a period of two hours in two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or related conditions who were experiencing symptoms of agitation.
All of the studies measured the change in the patient’ s symptoms using a standard scale for schizophrenia.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder, there were eight main studies looking at Abilify taken by mouth.
There were five short-term studies that compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three weeks in a total of 1,900 patients.
Two of these studies used haloperidol and lithium (another antipsychotic medicine) as comparators and continued for a further nine weeks to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicines.
Another study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 weeks in 347 patients, and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 160 patients whose manic symptoms had already been stabilised using Abilify.
The eighth study looked at the effect of adding Abilify or placebo to existing treatment with lithium or valproate (another antipsychotic medicine) in 384 patients.
The effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection was compared with that of lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and of placebo over a period of two hours in one study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptoms of agitation.
All of these studies looked at the change in symptoms using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patients who responded to treatment.
The company also carried out studies looking at the absorption of the orodispersible tablets and oral solution by the body.
What benefit has Abilify shown during the studies?
When used to treat schizophrenia, Abilify was more effective than placebo in the short-term studies.
In the long-term studies, Abilify was more effective than placebo, and as effective as haloperidol, after up to a year of treatment.
In both studies of the solution for injection, patients receiving Abilify at doses of 5.25, 9.75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of agitation than those receiving placebo.
When used to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies.
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three weeks.
This effect was maintained for up to 12 weeks.
Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to existing treatment.
Injections of Abilify at doses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of agitation, and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam.
2/ 3 What is the risk associated with Abilify?
The most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or jerking), akathisia (constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), somnolence (sleepiness), sedation (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary hypersecretion (increased production of saliva), fatigue (tiredness), restlessness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and anxiety.
Akathisia is more common in patients with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophrenia.
Between 1 and 10 patients in 100 receiving injections of Abilify experience somnolence, dizziness, headache, akathisia, nausea and vomiting.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abilify, see the Package Leaflet.
Abilify should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Abilify been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Abilify’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.
It also decided that the benefits of the solution for injection outweighed its risks for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.
The Committee recommended that Abilify be given marketing authorisation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
6 Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
8 It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
9 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
10 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).

17 Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
19 It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
20 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
21 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
28 Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
30 It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
31 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
32 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
39 Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
Post-Marketing:
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance.
The frequency of these events is considered not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Investigations:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
41 It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
42 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
43 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink, marked with "A" over "640" on one side and "10" on the other.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
46 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
47 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
48 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
50 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
52 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
54 Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Orodispersible tablet Round and yellow, marked with "A" over "641" on one side and "15" on the other.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
58 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
59 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
60 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
62 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
64 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
66 Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

Excipient:
6 mg aspartame (E951) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink, marked with "A" over "643" on one side and "30" on the other.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
70 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
71 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
72 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
74 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
Post-Marketing:
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
76 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
78 Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
ABILIFY oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2).
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day (i. e.
10 or 15 ml solution/ day) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
A calibrated measuring cup and a 2 ml calibrated dropper are included in the carton.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day (i. e.
10 to 30 ml solution/ day).
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
15 ml solution/ day) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
30 ml solution/ day).
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
82 For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
83 Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
84 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Intolerance:
The oral solution contains fructose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).
The oral solution contains sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
85 When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
86 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
88 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N = 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N = 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution.
At equivalent doses, the peak plasma concentrations of aripiprazole (Cmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
90 exposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets.
In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122% (N = 30).
The single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were
91 observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For intramuscular use.
To enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended.
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1).
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as a single intramuscular injection.
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg as a single injection.
A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).
A second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period.
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of aripiprazole).
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to
94 establish recommendations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or older has not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder.
Simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression.
If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly.
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products).
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
95 conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
96 Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
The administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly.
However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone.
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly.
However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone.
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.
98 4.8 Undesirable effects

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Other findings:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
101 Further information on clinical trials:
Agitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection:
In two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.
In one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam.
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole.
In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.
Schizophrenia with oral aripiprazole:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (oral aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43%) than for oral haloperidol (30%).
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in oral aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
102 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100%.
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations.
In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
103 Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures (AUC) that were 15 and 5 times, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular.
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) times human exposure at 30 mg.
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ABRAXANE
EPAR summary for the public
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Abraxane?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance paclitaxel (5 mg/ ml).
What is Abraxane used for?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first treatment for their metastatic disease has stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an ‘ anthracycline’ (a type of anticancer medicine) is not suitable. ‘ Metastatic’ means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
Abraxane is used on its own.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abraxane used?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in wards that are specialised in giving ‘ cytotoxic’ (cell-killing) medicines.
The recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area (calculated using the patient ’ s height and weight).
It is given over a period of 30 minutes, every three weeks.
The dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patients who have certain side effects affecting the blood or the nerves.
Abraxane should not be used in patients who have severe problems with their liver.
The appropriate doses for patients with mild or moderate liver problems or with kidney problems are not known.
How does Abraxane work?
The active substance in Abraxane, paclitaxel, belongs to the group of anticancer medicines known as the ‘ taxanes’.
Paclitaxel blocks the ability of cancer cells to break down their internal ‘ skeleton ’ that allows them to divide and multiply.
With their skeleton still in place, the cells cannot divide and they eventually die.
Abraxane also affects non-cancer cells such as blood and nerve cells, which can cause side effects.
Paclitaxel has been available as an anticancer medicine since 1993.
Conventional types of paclitaxel contain substances (solvents) that dissolve the paclitaxel, but can cause side effects.
Abraxane does not contain these solvents.

How has Abraxane been studied?
The effects of Abraxane were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The company also presented data from the published literature.
The effectiveness of Abraxane has been studied in one main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past.
Around half of the patients in the study had already received treatments for their cancer after it had become metastatic.
The effects of Abraxane (given on its own) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine (given together with other medicines to reduce side effects).
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients who ‘ responded ’ after at least five weeks of treatment.
This was defined as the patient’ s main tumours having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30%.
What benefit has Abraxane shown during the studies?
Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
Overall, in the main study, 72 (31%) of the 229 women receiving Abraxane responded to treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
When looking only at the patients who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in terms of measures of effectiveness such as the time until the disease got worse and survival.
In contrast, in patients who had taken other treatments for metastatic breast cancer before, these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
Therefore, the company withdrew its application for the use of Abraxane as first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine.
What is the risk associated with Abraxane?
The most common side effects with Abraxane (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), leucopenia (low levels of leucocytes, a type of white blood cell), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), lymphopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), neuropathy (nerve damage), hypoaesthesia (reduced sense of touch), paraesthesia (unusual sensations like pins and needles), nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), alopecia (hair loss), rash, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), anorexia (loss of appetite), fatigue (tiredness), asthenia (weakness) and pyrexia (fever).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abraxane, see the Package Leaflet.
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used in patients who are breast feeding or who have low levels of neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment.
Why has Abraxane been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped working, and that, unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines, it does not need other medicines to reduce side effects.
The Committee decided that Abraxane’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated.
The Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Abraxane:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience Limited on 11 January 2008.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated (See also section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents.
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6.
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.
Dose adjustments during treatment:
Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses.
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2.
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses.
2 Patients with hepatic impairment:
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2).
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel.
Patients with impaired renal function:
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric patients:
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.
Elderly patients:
In the clinical studies, no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Lactation.
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 and 5.2)..
Hypersensitivity:
If hypersensitivity occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel.
Haematology:
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) occurs frequently with Abraxane.
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity.
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy.
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy:
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane, although development of severe symptoms is less common.
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction.
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended (see section 4.2).
3 Hepatic Impairment:
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression, and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression.
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown.
Cardiotoxicity:
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated, cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population, especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events.
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men, and one month after treatment for women (see section 4.6).
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases has not been established.
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy.
Gastrointestinal Symptoms:
If patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents.
Excipients:
When reconstituted, Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose.
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2).
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (e. g. erythromycin, fluoxetine, imidazole antifungals) or induce (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy.
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy:
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy.
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy, and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel.
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane.
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment.
Lactation:
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk.
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants, Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation.
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy.
Fertility:
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats (see section 5.3).
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery.
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Neutropenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients), and was rapidly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.
Grade 4 neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/ l) occurred in 9% of patients treated with Abraxane.
Febrile neutropenia occurred in four patients on Abraxane.
Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/ dl) was observed in 46% of patients on Abraxane, and was severe (Hb < 8 g/ dl) in three cases.
Lymphopenia was observed in 45% of the patients.
Nervous system disorders:
In general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients receiving Abraxane.
Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 68% of patients on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4.
Gastrointestinal disorders:
Nausea occurred in 29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients.
Skin and subcutaneous system disorders:
Alopecia was observed in 90% of the patients treated with Abraxane.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Arthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 6% of cases.
Myalgia occurred in 24% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases.
The symptoms were usually transient, typically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and resolved within a week.
General disorders and administration site disorders:
Asthenia/ Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients.

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies, vocal cord paresis, and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane.
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane.
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established.
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely monitored.
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are bone marrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Taxanes, ATC Code:
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation.
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.
In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “ bundles ” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles.
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells.
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).
Breast carcinoma:
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer.
This information is presented below.
Single-arm open-label studies
In one study, Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support.
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals.
The response rates in all patients were 39.5% (95% CI:
24.9% - 54.2%) and 47.6%
35.3% - 60.0%), respectively.
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months (175 mg/ m2; 95% CI:
4.6 – 6.2 months) and 6.1 months (300 mg/ m2; 95% CI:
4.2 – 9.8 months).
Randomised comparative study:
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases.
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings.
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy.
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines.
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below.

* This data is based on Clinical Study Report:
CA012-0 Addendum dated Final (23 March-2005) a Chi-squared test b Log-rank test
9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized, controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety.
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy.
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies.
The drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng. hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2.
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner.
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel, which occurred at the end of the infusion, was 18.7 µg/ ml.
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2.
The terminal half-life was about 27 hours.
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel.
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours.
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger (43%) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (53%).
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion.
There were no differences in terminal half-lives.
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90%.
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM, indicate that about 87% of paclitaxel is bound; the presence of ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel.
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8, -3A4, and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively.
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated.
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4% of the total administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating extensive non-renal clearance.
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years.
However, little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied.
However, based on the published literature, paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action.
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice).
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/ HGPRT) gene mutation assay.
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats.

After reconstitution, each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel.
Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial.
The solution should not be injected directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming.
Once the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the solid.
Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/ or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs.
The generation of foam must be avoided.
If foaming or clumping occurs, the solution must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides.
The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates.
If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use.
Some settling of the reconstituted suspension may occur.
Complete resuspension should be ensured by mild agitation before use.
Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed.
Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ ml suspension required for the patient and inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag.
The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions.
In-line filters should not be used.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

ABSEAMED
EPAR summary for the public
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Abseamed?
Abseamed is a solution for injection.
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international units (IU) of the active substance, epoetin alfa.
Abseamed is a ‘ biosimilar’ medicine.
This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also known as the ‘ reference medicine’).
The reference medicine for Abseamed is Eprex/ Erypo.
For more information on biosimilar medicines, see the question-and-answer document here.
What is Abseamed used for?
Abseamed is used in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) that is causing symptoms in patients with ‘ chronic renal failure’ (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or other kidney problems; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions; • to increase the amount of blood that can be take in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery (autologous blood transfusion); • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery, such as hip surgery.
It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion, if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abseamed used?
Treatment with Abseamed must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for.
For patients with kidney problems and patients who are going to donate their own blood, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.

The dose, the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Abseamed is being used, and are adjusted according to the patient’ s response.
For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilitre in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl in children).
Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.
For these patients, the lowest dose that provides adequate control of symptoms should be used.
The iron levels of all patients should be checked before treatment to make sure that they are not too low, and iron supplements should be used throughout treatment.
For full details, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Abseamed work?
A hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells from the bone marrow.
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys.
In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin, or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it has naturally.
In these cases, erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell counts.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and help minimise the consequences of blood loss.
The active substance in Abseamed, epoetin alfa, is a copy of human erythropoietin and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production.
The epoetin alfa in Abseamed is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce epoetin alfa.
How has Abseamed been studied?
Abseamed was studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine, Eprex/ Erypo, in experimental models and in humans.
Abseamed, injected into a vein, was compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems.
All of the patients had been taking Eprex/ Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or remained on Eprex/ Erypo.
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period, between weeks 25 and 29.
The company also presented the results of a study comparing the effects of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Eprex/ Erypo in 114 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy.
What benefit has Abseamed shown during the studies?
Abseamed was as effective as Eprex/ Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell counts.
In the study of patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems, patients switching to Abseamed maintained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo.
On average, the levels of the patients taking Abseamed increased by 0.147 g/ dl from a starting value of 11.7 g/ dl.
In comparison, those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g/ dl from a starting value of 12.0 g/ dl.
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Abseamed was also as effective as Eprex/ Erypo when it was injected under the skin.
What is the risk associated with Abseamed?
The most common side effect with Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion.
Abseamed can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptoms.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abseamed, see the Package Leaflet.
Abseamed should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in the following groups: • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack or stroke within the last month, who have angina pectoris (a severe type of chest pain) or who are at risk of deep 2/ 3 venous thrombosis (DVT: formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body, usually in the leg); • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke.
Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
2 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
3 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
4 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
13 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
16 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
17 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
18 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
26 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
27 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
30 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
31 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
32 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
40 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
41 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
44 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
45 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
46 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
51 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
54 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
55 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
58 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
59 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
60 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
68 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
69 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
72 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
73 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
74 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
79 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.

No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
82 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
83 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
86 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
87 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
88 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
92 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
96 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
97 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
100 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
101 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
102 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
103 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
106 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
107 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
110 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
111 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
114 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
115 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
116 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
117 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
120 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
124 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
125 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications.
128 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
129 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
130 avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
131 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Target Hb (approx.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regresses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be assured:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
134 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
135 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patients in autologous predonation programmes
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected.
138 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
139 18 hours postdose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators.
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.
